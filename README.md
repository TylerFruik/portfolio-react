# Module 20 | REACT | React Portfolio

## Finished Product

### [ðŸ”—Project Link]() 
This website will serve as my primary professional portfoilo.
Still to be implemented is the function to sort projects by keywords. Additionally, the Contact Me form currently does not work. Looking to resolve that as swiftly as possible. All other links work perfectly. The website is not yet suited for mobile. There is also not a resume available for download yet as I am still updating my existing resume.

This project was developed using the following skills: 
React, Bootstrap, Node, JS, HTML, CSS

All code is neatly commented for clarity's sake.

All code written manually by Tyler Fruik.
